# Hill Cipher
## Introduction

The hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra (primarily matrices), invented by Lester S. Hill in 1929. This project was written based on the guidelines set by [Dr. Xunhua Wang](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/wangxx/Web/generalhp/SteveHome.html) from James Madison University for CS327 (Discrete Structures II) in the Fall semester of 2024. This project is a recreation of the hill cipher using 2x2 matrices to encrypt and decrypt messages in Java, designed to practice the concepts of encryption/decryption algorithms, discrete structures, and brute-forcing techniques.
